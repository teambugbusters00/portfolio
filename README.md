* Demonstrate frontend + creative engineering skills
* Show readiness for modern web development roles

## ⚠️ Notes (Real-world review)

* 3D portfolios are **excellent for showcasing creativity**, but for corporate hiring (SDE roles), always keep a **simple PDF resume alongside this**.
* Avoid overloading 3D effects — performance matters more than visuals.
* This portfolio works best as a **supplement**, not a replacement for a resume.
